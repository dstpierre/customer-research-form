# Quick customer research form

I needed a simple customer research form to capture learnings when talking to customers 
at [Roadmaap](https://roadmap.space).

It was my first Elm application and I wanted it to be dead simple, but I wanted to create 
something in production to have a real taste of Elm.

The form sends the learnings to an email address and optionally can be used to add learnings 
as feedback on a Roadmap account. 

This code is released here to compliment my article I posted regarding my experiences with Elm 
for a simple application.
